This forked repo contains our exploration of the informed attention model in improving codesearch results. The attention is evaluated on different source code representations i.e. AST traversals, AST parent-child relationships, etc. The branches with the relevant models are **informed-attention-prod** and **strict-informed-attention-prod**.
